# WhatsTheWeather
What's the weather like as we approach the equator? 

As most would correctly guess, the weather becomes warmer closer to the equator. However, what if you had to prove it with hard data?
This is a data analysis showing the relationship of weather patterns to the equator

Notes and Considerations:

The data used in this example was pulled at 11:00 AM EST on December 23, 2017.

Graphs in this output are flipped along the axes, that is, the independent is on the Y-axis and the dependent is on the X-axis. I purposefully flipped in this case since we are looking at the relationship of how far away a city is from the equator to its current weather. On the graphs, the line y = 0 would represent the equator, making the graphs an easier representation of how we generally look at the world.

The data pulled through OpenWeatherMap.com is in imperial units, meaning temp is displayed in Fahrenheit.

Feel free to run this exercise at different times to see how time and data change the data.
