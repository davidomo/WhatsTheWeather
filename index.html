	<h1>What's the weather as you approach the equator?</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		A simple question really. Moreso a simple answer. It seems everyone knows that it's hotter at the equator. That latitude always is either dry, arid deserts or moist, tropical rain forests. But could you prove it, without a doubt, that the weather is warmer there?
	</p>
	<p>
		This project was a chance to set that to the limit. Using a <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">public weather API</a> and some Python scripts, I was able to make an outputs to graph the temperature and other important weather realtaed attributes to prove the simple question.
