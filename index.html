	<h1>What's the weather like as we approach the equator??</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		As most would correctly guess, the weather becomes warmer closer to the equator. However, what if you had to prove it with hard data? This is a data analysis showing the relationship of weather patterns to the equator

		<h3> Notes and Considerations</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Graphs in this output are flipped along the axes, that is, the independent is on the Y-axis and the dependent is on the X-axis. I purposefully flipped in this case since we are looking at the relationship of how far away a city is from the equator to its current weather. On the graphs, the line y = 0 would represent the equator, making the graphs an easier representation of how we generally look at the world.
		</li>
		<li>
			The data pulled through this <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">open sourced public API </a>is in imperial units, meaning temp is displayed in Fahrenheit.
		</li>

			Feel free to run this exercise at different times to see how time and data change the data.
